MakeRocketGoNow is a 'quicklaunch' plugin based on "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1.
MRGN will take all your LDB launchers and create a LDB plugin to display them in.
This allows you to access to all your LDB launchers on an LDB display addon that doesn't support them.

h2. Adding support to your addon

Implementing an LDB launcher in your addon is simple:
# Add the embed libs into your addon.  You need "LibStub":http://www.wowwiki.com/LibStub, "CallbackHandler-1.0":http://www.wowace.com/wiki/CallbackHandler-1.0 and "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1
# Add a "dataobject" to LibDataBroker containing an icon, an OnClick function, and "type" set to "launcher"

<em>If you use Ace3 in your addon, you probably already have the first two embeds.  Just make sure they're loaded before LibDataBroker</em>

h2. Further reading

It's highly recommended that you read the "API documentation":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis/api and
"sample data specifications":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis/data-specifications before using LDB.
