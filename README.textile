MakeRocketGoNow is a 'quicklaunch' plugin based on "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1.
MRGN will take all your LDB launchers and create a LDB plugin to display them in.
This allows you to access to all your LDB launchers on an LDB display addon that doesn't support them.

h2. Adding support to your addon

Implementing an LDB launcher in your addon is simple:
# Add the embed libs into your addon.  You need "LibStub":http://www.wowwiki.com/LibStub, "CallbackHandler-1.0":http://www.wowace.com/wiki/CallbackHandler-1.0 and "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1
#* If you use Ace3 in your addon, you probably already have the first two embeds.  Just make sure they're loaded before LibDataBroker
# Add a "dataobject" to LibDataBroker containing an icon, an OnClick function, and "launcher" set to true
#* The "launcher" key tells display addons that you do not provide any "data" to be rendered, simply an OnClick action to attach to a frame

h3. Example:

Here is a simple launcher that will open a config panel:

<pre>
LibStub:GetLibrary("LibDataBroker-1.1"):NewDataObject("MyAddonName", {
	launcher = true,
	icon = "Interface\\Icons\\Spell_Nature_StormReach",
	OnClick = function(clickedframe, button) InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToFrame(myconfigframe) end,
})
</pre>

h3. Further reading

It's highly recommended that you read the "API documentation":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis/api and
"sample data specifications":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis/data-specifications before using LDB.
